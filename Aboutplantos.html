<h2 id="Why">Why is Botany important?</h2>
 <p>Plants make up 82% of our global biomass, and they have more biodiversity than any animal species. Botany is the study of plants, how they grow, and conservation of
   endangered species. Without plants, everything would die, and with decreasing biodiversity as a result of human activities, we need to learn more about botanical sciences
   so we can curb our behaviors that damage ecosystems, conserve endangere species, and preserve biodiversity. 
 </p>
<h2 id="Vocab">Botanical Vocabulary</h2>
<p>It's okay to not know everything about a subject you like, science is a process of continual learning and it is impossible to have complete and comprehensive knowledge
  of how the world works. But learning some simple vocabulary terms can be useful in any field! Humans name things to give them meaning and diferentiation, so all these 
  different terms do serve a purpose and will elevate your ability to learn more about the things you love (I'm assuming you love botany, of course).

<h5>Gardening terms</h5>
 <p class="words">Annual - More of a gardening term for plants that complete their whole cycle of germination and fruiting/blooming in a year, and then dying. (i.e. herbaceous verbena, which die at the end of their growing season and reasprout through underground rhizomes the next season.)

<h2 id="How">How to Care for Plants (or at least most of them)</h2>

<h3>Basic Needs</h3>
<p>Pretty much every botanical organism shares some basic needs, namely water, soil, and sunlight. 
</p>
<h4>Water</h4>
<p>Water requirements for plants are typically based on their native climate. While this can be difficult to determine without knowing a plant's species, 
    usually physical features such as succulent or waxy leaves, or brittle or bendy wood, can indicate the water requirements of a plant. 
    <p>Succulents are technically herbaceous, but store water in their leaves, and usually have thick, fluid filled leaves because of this. They are different from cacti in this way, as cacti store water in their 
    stems, and have adapted their leaves into needles. This is contrary to popular belief that succulents and cacti are the same, and therefore can equally tolerate
    drought. Both are drought tolerant, but cacti can go much longer without being watered, and are actually more prone to overwatering. Both should be watered using
    soak and dry method, meaning soaking their soil in water and allowing to dry completely before watering again. Cacti usually don't give much indication of 
    underwatering, other than possible becoming shriveled, but succulents leaves will become brown and crinkly and drop. Both will turn yellow if overwatered, and look
    as if they are bulging with water. Sometimes this can lead to root rot, so be very careful with watering if you see yellowing around the base of a succulent or cacti stem, And
    if the stem begins to turn black and drop leaves, it is rotting and needs to be cut off. Tropical succulents can usually take more water, but are still prone to 
    overwatering, so wait antil the soil is barely damp before rewatering.</p> 
    <p> Herbs need a little more care, and usually need more water. Some woody herbs like
        rosemary and other shrubs can go a while without watering, and usually indicate dehydration through dry, brittle stems. Herbs like mint, however, need contantly
        moist soil. Some people will say you can let them dry out before rewatering. Those people are lying. In Texas, plants that usually would need more spaced
        out watering intervals can go less time before getting dehydrated, especially when grown outdoors. This can lead to leaf burning and infection. Don't let those leaves 
        get all crinkly or else there's no going back. 
</p></p>
<h4>Sunlight</h4>
<p>All plants(as well as some algaes and microorganisms) perform photosynthesis, though depending on native climates they do so to different extents. Plants from
    shadier, heavily forested regions with thick canopies tend to be rather intolerant of direct sunlight, and have leaves that burn very easily, such as ferns. Plants
    from hot, dry areas store moisture in their stems and leaves and therefore are more tolerant to direct sunlight. Most plants can only tolerate partial sun, 
    but will droop or become leggy if grown in an area that's to shady.  
</p>
<h4>Soil</h4>
<p>CLAY SOIL IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD HATE IT AS MUCH AS I DO. If nothing else, that is what you need to know about soil. Pretty much my whole yard has clay soil and it's a nightmare.
    This is prone to happen in areas with heavy rainfall, land neglect, and poor drainage (like at the bottom of a hill or slope). IT SUCKS AND KILLS EVERYTHING. It's also
    why you should always by good quality soil if planning a garden bed. Clay soil is cheap, but it will cost you more in the long run and malnourish your plants.

<h2 id="Whyagainiforgot">Why You Should Care </h2>

<p>Okay I will admit this started as just rambling because I have an outlet for all my planty interest now, 
    but this project was supposed to be a website with a purpose, and while me sharing all my cool plant pics 
    and babbling about botany seems pretty purposeless, there really is purpose to be foun in cultivating and 
    caring for native and foreign plants. Here's some facts about invasive species, plant conservation, and the 
     role plants play in our ecosystem. </p>

     <h3>Invasive plants</h3>
      <p>Invasive plants are a huge issue, especially in Texas. They disturb local ecosystems by competing with native plant populations for resources, 
        genetically evolving more quickly than surrounding organisms, and killing plants that are a part of native animals' diets, which can cause overall
        population decline in anything that is livng, which is bad. Some invasive plants spread naturally, but a lot are spread by human activity. Rosemary is an example of 
        an invasive herb in Texas, and it should only be grown in pots. </p>

     <h3>Deforestation</h3>
     <P>Deforestation is an entirely human activity that causees catastrophic damage to ecosystems and botanical communities. </P>
     <h3>Irresponsible Imports</h3>
        <p> A new market for houseplants has arrisen in recent years, and while this is great and benefits both plants and gardeners, and gives people in urban areas access
         to botany, it has also sparked an illegal trade of exotic plants across oceans and biomes, which can cause environmental havoc. This can bring invasive plants and 
         insects into ecosystems that have no place for them, leading to imbalance of food and water chains and overpopulation, as well as the spreading of pathogens. 
         Make sure you buy your plants from responsible growers, and pay attention to whether a plant on the market is an endangered species. </p>
