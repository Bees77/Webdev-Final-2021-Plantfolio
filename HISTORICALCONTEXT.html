<h2 id="Humans">Botanical Pioneers</h2>
<h4>George Washington Carver</h4>
<p>George Washington Carver is probably one of the biggest revolutionaries in American Agriculture to date, and the most influential American botanist.</p>
<h4>Gregor Mendel</h4>
<p>Perhaps one of the most famous botanists, Gregor Mendel was a friar  who used pea plant chromosomes to establish the foundational theory of genetics in western science.</p>
<h4>Katherine Essau</h4>
<p>Katherine Essau was a German-American scientist given a National Medal of Science for her botanical work. </p>
<h4>Emma Lucy Braun</h4>
<p> Emma Lucy Braun was a prominant arborialist and botanist in the U.S.</p>
<h4>Janaki Ammal</h4>
<p> Janaki Ammal was one of the first women to attain a PhD in botany in the U.S., and her research contributed greatly to our current knowledge of chromosomes in agricultural crops.</p>
<h4>Ynes Mexia</h4>
<p>Ynes Mexia was one of the most successful botanical journalists and collectors of her time, and travelled across the americas to find her specimens. </p>
<h4>Mari Clark Taylor</h4>

<h4>Gertrude Webster</h4>
<h4>Pliny the Elder</h4>
<p>Pliny the Elder was so,so, so wrong about everything, essentially a Jack of all trades and master of absolutely none in terms of historic sciences,
  but I'm giving him an honorable mention because I find him extremely amusing, and he has "contributed" to nearly all my areas of interest.

<h3>Agriculture vs. Botany</h3>
<p>Agriculture and Botany are often considered to be two branches within the same discipline, and to an extent this is true, 
  but they have different focuses and histories. Historically, botanists are known for discovery and research while agriculturalists 
  for cultivation of specific crops. Both require skill, and often work together, but unfortuneately agriculture usually does not take 
  a very holistic approach. With a move towards mroe sustainable agrivulture, permaculture, and reforestation, that may change for the 
  better, but when talking about the history of botanical exploration and agricultural cultivation it is important to diffrentiate.</p>

<h2 id="Art">Botanical Art and Illustration</h2>
<p>Botanical Art and Illustration have a long history and are essential to the study of botany. Botanical art is usually made for aesthetic purposes with identification in mind, but botanical illustration is always made scientifically. 
  In Europe, Botanical Art was essential to the funding of exploration expeditions. Court artists for kings would often join scientists, 
  or take up the sciences themselves, and bring back valuable pieces for royals, incentivising them to continue funding exploration.</p>
