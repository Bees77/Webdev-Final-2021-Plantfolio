<h3> Page Summary</h3>
<h4>quicklinks</h4>
<h2>Why is Botany important</h2>
 <p>Plants make up 82% of our global biomass, and they have more biodiversity than any animal species. Botany is the study of plants, how they grow, and conservation of
   endangered species. Without plants, everything would die, and with decreasing biodiversity as a result of human activities, we need to learn more about botanical sciences
   so we can curb our behaviors that damage ecosystems, conserve endangere species, and preserve biodiversity. 
 </p>
<h2>Botanical Vocabulary</h2>
<p>It's okay to not know everything about a subject you like, science is a process of cntinual learning and it is impossible to have complete and comprehensive knowledge
  of how the world works. But learning some simple vocabulary terms can be useful in any field! Humans name things to give them meaning and diferentiation, so all these 
  different terms do serve a purpose and will elevate your ability to learn more about the things you love (I'm assuming you love botany, of course).

<h2>Properties of Plants</h2>
<P> Plants work entirely differently than animals or bacteria, even their cells are different. When we think about the way plants grow, usually photosynthesis comes to mind. 
  But how does photosynthesis work? And what other things contribute to the growth of plants? How do they adapt, and how does that reflect animal evolution?
</P>

<h2>How to Care for Plants (or at least most of them)</h2>


<h2>Why You Should Care (hear that??? I'm about to guilt you into pretending to also be interested in my special interest >:0)</h2>

<p>Okay I will admit this started as just rambling because I have an outlet for all my planty interest now, 
    but this project was supposed to be a website with a purpose, and while me sharing all my cool plant pics 
    and babbling about botany seems pretty purposeless, there really is purpose to be foun in cultivating and 
    caring for native and foreign plants. Here's some facts about invasive species, plant conservation, and the 
     role plants play in our ecosystem. </p>

     <h3>Invasive plants</h3>
      <p>Invasive plants are a huge issue, especially in Texas. They disturb local ecosystems by competing with native plant populations for resources, 
        genetically evolving more quickly than surrounding organisms, and killing plants that are a part of native animals' diets, which can cause overall
        population decline in anything that iss livng, which is bad. Some invasive plants spread naturally, but a lot are spread by human activity. Rosemary is an example of 
        an invasive herb in Texas, and it should only be grown in pots. </p>

     <h3>Deforestation</h3>
     <P>Deforestation is an entirely human activity that causees catastrophic damage to ecosystems and botanical communities. </P>
     <h3>Irresponsible Imports</h3>
        <p> A new market for houseplants has arrisen in recent years, and while this is great and benefits both plants and gardeners, and gives people in urban areas access
         to botany, it has also sparked an illegal trade of exotic plants across oceans and biomes, which can cause environmental havoc. This can bring invasive plants and 
         insects into ecosystems that have no place for them, leading to imbalance of food and water chains and overpopulation, as well as the spreading of pathogens. 
         Make sure you buy your plants from responsible growers, and pay attention to whether a plant on the market is an endangered species. </p>
